# RTP Platform Quality Assurance Repository

This repository contains a comprehensive set of tests for various aspects of the RTP platform, including functional
tests, BDD tests, UX tests, performance tests, contract tests, and end-to-end tests. These tests are implemented using Python and appropriate
libraries for each type of testing.

- [Test Overview](#test-overview)
    - [Functional Tests](#functional-tests)
    - [BDD Tests](#bdd-tests)

    - [Performance Tests](#performance-tests)
    - [Contract Tests](#contract-tests)
    - [End-to-End Tests](#end-to-end-tests)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/platform-testing-repo.git
cd platform-testing-repo
```

### 2. Get secrets

Obtain `secrets.yaml` file (based on `config/secrets_template.yaml`) from admins and place it under `config/`.

### 3. Create a virtual environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

1. Create virtual environment:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
  ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. Upgrade pip:

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

4. Install local packages:

  ```bash
  pip install -e .
  ```

### 4. Install specific dependencies for test type

Dependencies are managed via `pyproject.toml` extras. Use the Makefile for installation:

#### Functional Tests:

```bash
make install-functional
```

#### BDD Tests:

```bash
make install-bdd
```

#### UX Tests:

```bash
make install-ux
```

#### Performance Tests:

```bash
make install-performance
```

#### Contract Tests:

```bash
make install-contract
```

#### End-to-End Tests:

```bash
make install-end-to-end
```

## Test Overview

### Functional Tests

Functional tests verify the basic functionality of the platform. We use pytest for writing and running these tests.

- Location: functional-tests/
- Tool: pytest
- Configuration: pyproject.toml
- Command to run:

```bash
make test-functional
```

### BDD Tests

BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) tests are written using behave, which allows defining scenarios in Gherkin syntax to
describe user behaviors and expectations.

- Location: bdd-tests/
- Tool: behave
- Feature files: bdd-tests/features/
- Step definitions: bdd-tests/steps/
- Configuration: behave.ini
- Command to run:

```bash
make test-bdd
```

### UX Tests

UX tests validate the user experience and interaction flow using Playwright for browser automation.

- Location: ux-tests/
- Tool: Playwright
- Configuration: playwright.config.py
- Command to run:

```bash
make test-ux
```

### Performance Tests

Performance tests help evaluate how the platform performs under heavy performance or high traffic using Locust.

- Location: performance-tests/
- Tool: Locust
- Configuration: locustfile.py
- Command to run:

```bash
locust -f performance-tests/locustfile.py --headless --users 5 --spawn-rate 1 --run-time 10 --host=http://example.com
```

### Contract Tests

Contract tests use Schemathesis to generate random input values to test the adhesion to OpenAPI specification of the
service.

- Location: contract-tests/
- Tool: Schemathesis
- Command to run:

```bash
make test-contract
```

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests validate the full user journey and integration points, focusing on flaky or timeout-sensitive scenarios.

- Location: end-to-end-test/
- Tool: pytest
- Configuration: pyproject.toml
- Command to run:

```bash
make test-end-to-end
```

## Secrets Management on GitHub
GitHub actions uses a repository environments variables that are used by the config to settle up a configuration dictionary.
All the envs and secrets are inside the repository's environment section under env vars and secret.
For each environment we have to specify all the variables:
dev, uat and prod.
For now we are going to use just the UAT env.

This secret must be updated manually by admins when needed.
